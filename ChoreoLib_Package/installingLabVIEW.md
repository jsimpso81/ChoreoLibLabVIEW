ChoreoLib is provided for installation as a NI Package (NIPKG) file.  Follow these steps to download and install:

1. Download the ChoreoLib package and pre-requisite packages.  ChoreoLib depends on the WPILIB LabVIEW Math library.  The install package can be found here:

Download the packages required for the version of LabVIEW being used.  The LabVIEW 2020 packages have 2020 embedded within their file name.  The other packages are for LabVIEW 2019.  FRC 2023 is using LabVIEW 2020.
